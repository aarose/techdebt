# What It Is

A metaphor.

class: center, middle

Debt (IRL) == you owe $$ to someone

Technical Debt == you owe code ("proper"/fixed code) to yourself, the project, your team


---

# What It Is

**Unintentional**
"...a design approach just turns out to be error-prone or a junior programmer just writes bad code."

**Intentional**
"...an organization makes a conscious decision to optimize for the present rather than for the future."

# Why It's Bad

Well, isn't inherently bad.

"Just as a business incurs some debt to take advantage of a market opportunity developers may incur technical debt to hit an important deadline."
- Martin Fowler [Source](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html)

---

## But When It Is Bad...

"Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments[...] extra effort"
- Martin Fowler

# Why The Metaphor Is Bad

Sometimes, it's misleading.

---

# How to Address the Bad

## Minimal Payments

"Keeping your unintended debt down gives you more room to intentionally take on debt."

## Debt ceiling

---

# Bonus: Technical Inflation

"Technical Inflation could be viewed as the ground lost when the current level of technology surpasses that of the foundation of your product to the extent that it begins losing compatibility with the industry."

Example: falling behind in versions of a language to the point where your code is no longer compatible with the mainstream

- Scott Wood
